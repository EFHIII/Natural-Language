- 1,000,000 word vectors (word embeddings) form Facebook's FastText

- Network plan:
- turn million word vectors into an object and save as a .JSON
- ~100 word history/channel
- save channel histories as .JSON in the form {{[w1,w2,e3...],[msg],[msg]},{channel},{channel}...}
- train via taking history and back-propogating responses

-Network design:

input:[100 wordVec history(each word=300 nodes)]
total 30,000 input nodes

output:[terminate?,optimal-wordVec (300 nodes)]

using:
- npm: brain
- npm: vector object
